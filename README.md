Project Management Web Application
A web application for managing project workflows, allowing users to create and track the progress of their projects.
It enables team collaboration by assigning employees to projects and facilitating interaction within the platform. The application is structured into three spaces:
 * Administration – Manages users, permissions, and overall system settings.
 * Project Manager – Oversees project progress, assigns tasks, and manages teams.
 * Employees – View assigned projects, update task status, and communicate with the team.
